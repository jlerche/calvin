# Calvin

This is a prototypical (read: experimental) implementation of [Daniel Abadi's Calvin paper](http://cs.yale.edu/homes/thomson/publications/calvin-sigmod12.pdf).

## Future Work

* richer data model
* build partitions and make partitions mobile
* cluster rebalancing
* move stored to procedures to JS as that comes with a protobuf library :)
